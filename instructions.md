## Your Mission: Build an AI-Powered Chatbot

Your task is to create a unique and functional AI-powered chatbot. The specific personality, purpose, and design of the chatbot are entirely up to you. Get creative. Build something that's useful, interesting, or just plain fun.

## Core Requirements:

A Chat Interface: A clean, intuitive interface for a user to send messages and receive responses.

Secure API Key Input: A field where the user can securely input their own OpenAI (or other provider) API key. This key must be stored locally in the browser (e.g., using localStorage) and should not be sent to any server.

Live Functionality:The app must successfully make calls to an LLM, enabling a real-time conversation.

## Core Constraints & Tools:

Tech Stack: You must use React and TypeScript.
